How does skewness affect the interpretation of data?\n\nAnswer - Skewness refers to the measure of asymmetry in the distribution of data. It indicates whether the data points are distributed symmetrically about the mean or are concentrated more toward one side.\n\nTypes of Skewness\n\n1.Positive Skewness (Right-Skewed)\n\n- The tail on the right side of the distribution is longer.\n- Most data points are concentrated on the lower values, with a few larger values stretching the tail.\n- Example: Income distribution in a population where a few individuals earn significantly more than the rest.\n- Effect on Mean: Mean > Median > Mode.\n\n2.Negative Skewness (Left-Skewed)\n\n- The tail on the left side of the distribution is longer.\n- Most data points are concentrated on the higher values, with a few smaller values stretching the tail.\n- Example: Age of retirement where the majority retire late but a few retire very early.\n- Effect on Mean: Mean < Median < Mode.\n\n3.No Skewness (Symmetrical Distribution)\n\nThe left and right sides of the distribution are mirror images.\nThe mean, median, and mode are equal.\nExample: Heights of individuals in a normally distributed population.\n\n\nHow Skewness Affects Data Interpretation\n\n1.Central Tendency\n\nIn skewed distributions, the mean is pulled in the direction of the tail, making the median a better measure of central tendency.\n\n2.Spread of Data\n\nSkewness affects the interpretation of variability and can exaggerate the range of values.\n\n3.Statistical Analysis\n\nMany statistical tests assume a normal distribution. Skewed data may violate these assumptions, requiring data transformation or non-parametric tests.\n\n4.Real-World Implications\n\nPositive skewness in income suggests wealth inequality.\nNegative skewness in retirement age might indicate fewer people retiring early.",

Discrete Random Variables\n\nA discrete random variable can take only a countable number of distinct values.\nThese values are often integers or whole numbers.\nThe possible outcomes can be listed or counted.\n\nExamples:\nNumber of heads when flipping a coin 5 times (can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).\nNumber of goals scored by a soccer team in a match (e.g., 0, 1, 2, etc.).\nNumber of students passing an exam in a class.\n\nCharacteristics:\nThe set of possible outcomes is finite or countably infinite.\nProbability distribution is described by a probability mass function (PMF).\n\n\n\n2. Continuous Random Variables\n\nA continuous random variable can take on any value within a given range or interval.\nThese values are uncountable and can include fractions or decimals.\nThe set of possible outcomes is an entire interval or continuum of values.\n\nExamples:\nHeight of a person (can be any value between, say, 0 to 3 meters).\nTime taken for a car to complete a race (can be any value, like 12.56 seconds, 12.567 seconds, etc.).\nTemperature measured in a city.\n\nCharacteristics:\nThe set of possible outcomes is uncountably infinite.\nProbability distribution is described by a probability density function (PDF).\n",
